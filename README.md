Hello, I'm Michael Thompson, and I've had a diverse and exciting journey through the world of academia and data analysis. My educational path started with a Bachelor's degree in Business, where I focused on accounting and gained a solid understanding of financial practices. After spending several years as an auditor in the industry, I decided to return to school for a Master's program in Economics.

During my time in the Economics program, I encountered the fascinating field of econometrics. This opened up a whole new world of statistics, particularly regression analysis and time series analysis, which piqued my interest. This discovery led me to take a leap and transfer into the Mathematics department, where I began my journey to build a strong mathematical foundation. I delved into advanced subjects like graduate measure theory and multivariate analysis, enhancing my skills as an applied statistician.

My interdisciplinary projects have allowed me to combine machine learning methods such as clustering techniquesand principal component analysis with statistical methods such regression analysis, time series analysis, and multivariate data analysis. This fusion of expertise is invaluable in addressing real-world challenges and finding data-driven solutions. I'm passionate about exploring the intersections of mathematics, economics, and data science to search for solutions to real-world problems.

## Research

I have a strong passion for data analysis and its potential to drive positive societal change. In my most recent work, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of LAPD Traffic Stop Data to gain insights into law enforcement practices during traffic stops. Additionally, I'm intrigued by the COMPAS algorithm, a widely-used tool for assessing the risk of recidivism in the criminal justice system. In our fast-paced technological era, the implications of AI on human rights are multifaceted. My research interests form a critical foundation for exploring these complexities and advocating for transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in an increasingly data-driven world.

My research interests are interdisciplinary, not limited to the field of criminal justice. My robust background in economics, accounting, biostatistics, and survival analysis drives my interdisciplinary approach to research and leads to critical insights. My primary focus is on using data-driven insights to address complex societal challenges, with a commitment to promoting equity, fairness, and informed decision-making across a range of domains, spanning from criminal justice to economics to public health. Through my interdisciplinary research, I aspire to bridge the gap between data science and real-world impact.
